# Pokemon (Go) Colorscripts

Phoney Badger's Pokemon colorscripts wrapped with Go into a standalone, cross-platform binary.
All credit goes to Phoney Badger for the original pokemon-colorscripts project. You can find it [here](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts).

## ðŸ¤” Why?

Why use this over the original?

-   **Performance**: Go is compiled, so it doesn't rely on an interpreter like the original Python script. This generally results in faster execution times.
-   **Single binary**: Making full use of Go's [`embed`](https://golang.org/pkg/embed/) package, scripts and other assets are embedded directly into the binary. Resulting in a truly portable executable.
-   **Cross-platform**: This is a standalone binary that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   **No dependencies**: You don't need to install Python or any other dependencies to run this. Just drop the binary in your PATH and you're good to go.
